# TileVania

Working through the Tilevania section of [gamedev.tv's Unity 2D course](https://gamedev.tv/courses)
Built in Unity 2018.4.22f1

## Comments

The game is currently "as is" after completion of the course. It is extremely rough and has several obvious bugs in the game. It is a good show case for a number of Unity techniques but isn't great as a game!

## Instructions

### Running the code

* Clone the repo
* Open Unity
* Play the game!

## TODO

* Tune the game
* Level progression over a number of levels
* Add new enemies
* Add new hazards
* Add multiple players and split screen
* Polish!
* BUG: player can get stuck running along flat surfaces due to slightly off collision areas on tiles
